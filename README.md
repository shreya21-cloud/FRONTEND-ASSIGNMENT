To practice element creation, event handling, dynamic DOM updates, and persistent storage.

### 📌 Instructions

- When the user enters a task and clicks the button, append it to a `<ul>`.  
- Each task must include:  
  - **Edit** button  
  - **Delete** button  
- Editing should update the task **without page reload**.  
- Deleting should remove the task immediately.  

### ⭐ Bonus (5 Marks)
